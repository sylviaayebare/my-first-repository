  <h2> what is CSS</h2>
  <p> <strong>CSS  is the code that styles web content. </strong> 
      CSS basics walks through what you need to get started.
     We'll answer questions like:
      How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>css designes are made by use of the following selectors;<li>class <li>attribute <li>pseudo class</li></li><li>id <li></li></li></li></p>
    </p>
     <div id="content"><h1 style="color: #a708a7">PS; CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red</h1></div>

  The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
  
  Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
  
  Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly brackets.</p>
